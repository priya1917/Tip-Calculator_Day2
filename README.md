Tip Calculator ðŸ§®
Welcome to the Tip Calculator project!

This is my Day 2 project for the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. The Tip Calculator is a simple yet practical tool built in Python to calculate the tip amount and split the total bill among individuals.

About the Project
This project was a great opportunity to revisit and strengthen my understanding of basic arithmetic operations in Python. Despite its simplicity, it serves as a useful utility for real-life scenarios and highlights the importance of writing clean, beginner-friendly code.

Features
Calculate the total bill including tip.
Split the bill evenly among any number of people.
Handles user input with clear and intuitive prompts.
Enter the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people to split the billâ€”watch the calculator do the rest!

Key Learning Points
Refreshed understanding of basic arithmetic operations.
Improved attention to detail for handling user inputs and calculations.
Reinforced the habit of writing clear, logical, and efficient code.

Why This Project?
The Tip Calculator might seem simple, but itâ€™s a powerful reminder of how foundational skills can lead to practical and functional solutions. Itâ€™s a stepping stone in my journey to tackle more complex projects in the coming days.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects as I progress through the 100DaysOfCode Challenge! ðŸš€
